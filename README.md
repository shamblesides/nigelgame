Using pxcan, it's easy to quickly prototype a 2D pixelly game using JS! Here are some noteworthy features:

*   Crisp upscaling of pixel graphics
*   Built to let you handle different screen sizes
*   Designed to use sprite sheets
*   Easy to switch between different scenes
*   Mobile- and desktop-browser friendly

Documentation to come, once the design has solidified a bit.
